I think as a 3D artist, it's very easy to overcomplicate designs to the point where every additional detail has diminishing returns on the overall composition. During the 365 daily design challenge, I explored a lot of areas within 3D modelling but one thing that constantly bugged me was how sometimes it felt like I didn't have enough time to model what I was envisioning, texture it all and then render it out (r.i.p my 3060Ti). This ended with me feeling like I rushed a piece I was really looking forward to create and that's not a healthy head space for any artist let alone one taking part in a daily design challenge.

Creating the low-poly collection gave me a sense of relief each day; being able to finish a design earlier than usual *and* having time to cook dinner put a smile on my face for the first time in a few months of TAMZLY365. It also forced me to work in a new area of design I hadn't really touched before. I've been intrigued by low-poly modelling since I started in Blender but I never really understood how something so simplistic can look so good.

I have to give credit where credit is due when I say Roman Klƒço at [Polygun Runway](https://polygonrunway.com/) really helped with wrapping my head around low-poly modelling. Be sure to check him out for some amazing low-poly scene renders.
