Whilst I was completing the 365 daily design challenge, I learnt about [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) designs which, to save you a click and provide a TL:DR, are geometric shapes with a lot of detail at really small scales. I always think of it as looking at weird space rocks under a really powerful microscope. The simple complexity and randomness of every fractal I saw inspired me to create my own fractal designs. By this point in my year long design journey I was using Blender almost daily so it felt only right to once again delete the default cube only to add it back and mess around with displacement nodes.

Creating abstract art is so great because there's no blueprint to guide you, no rules for you to follow. You kind of just make whatever you want.

Feel free to download any of these to use as phone wallpapers, if any one is interested in desktop resolution wallpapers just send me a message and I can render it out in whatever resolution you want!
