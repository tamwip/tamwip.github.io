excerpt: Switching up my DAP to an iPod Classic but in 2024.
---
Around the time I switched out my Apple iPhone for a Google Pixel and replaced stock Android with CalyxOS, I also started purging most of my subscription services.

That included Spotify which was a gateway to a very important aspect of my life: music.

Within the space of a day I went from a plethora of playlists, over 20,000 liked songs and being able to discover new music weekly to... nothing.

I had no way to listen to any of my music on the go. Of course I could load up NewPipe (*my youtube client of choice, check out my alternative, non-google apps [here](https://tamirr.xyz/blog/degoogle/)*) and listen to basically an unlimited library of every song that ever existed, but it's missing that personal feeling.

I thought this would be a good opportunity to start being more intentional with my time and get a dedicated music player. Y2K rules.

# DAP

Digital Audio Player.

After quite a bit of back and forth I decided to pick up the Sony Walkman NW-A55L. It's the last Sony Walkman that isn't Android based, a big plus for battery life, and I can fit a microSD card in it. None of that iTunes syncing shenanigans.

I've been using the NW-A55L for just over a year and it's been great! But I missed that nostalgic feel.

# iPod Modding

I came across this video from DankPods where he managed to mod an iPod classic to facilitate 2TB of storage. A FLAC file is pretty large, so having 2TB was very appealing to me and the NW-A55L only has space for 1 microSD card, I'm capped at just over 1TB.

Well, I guess I went down the rabbit hole.

Mod videos after mod videos after mod videos. I was hooked, I knew exactly what features I wanted and what mods to get to achieve that.

I'm ready to make my perfect digital audio player and have ordered the following:

- iPod Classic 5.5th Generation (80gb with thick back)
- iFlash Quad Storage Adapter
- 3000mAh Battery
- A new front and back panel for aesthetics

Most of the parts are coming from China so I'll have to wait a while before the build takes place.

Needless to say, I'm very excited to get working on this.
