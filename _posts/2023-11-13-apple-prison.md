excerpt: "My life after breaking out of the Apple Ecosystem and finding unlimited potential in alternatives."

It's no secret that Apple has dominated the smartphone market for years. Not necessarily in sales, I recently saw a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mq9ajl/oc_how_the_smartphone_market_has_changed/) which shows Samsung having the largest market share, but nevertheless, Apple has been a huge player over the last decade and don't have any plans to really slow down.

I've been an Apple enthusiast (cough... fanboy) for years, I was fortunate enough for the iPhone 4 to be my very first smartphone and haven't drifted away from Apple since.

Over the years I've accumulated a number of redundant Apple devices with my latest purchase being an iPad mini 6, which despite the nature of this blog post I actually do still use!

I remember when I was in secondary school completing my GCSEs and how eager I would be for the Apple WWDC event to roll around every year - watching the livestreams in their entirety each time.

In the last few years I don't even remember seeing one event all the way through, most probably just watching the highlights on YouTube.

Has the novelty worn off? Have I grown out of Apple? Am I just bored of the same design every year?

# The Apple Ecosystem

Without a doubt, one of the main selling points of Apple products is their ecosystem. There isn't any other manufacturer who has created a fleet of smart devices which interact so fluidly with each other.

It starts with an iPhone, then perhaps some AirPods and an Apple Watch. Before you know it, you have an unused iPad sitting next to your bed, an Apple TV to watch Netflix shows on and a MacBook Pro to browse the Apple store page multiple times a month.

Apple are great at up-selling.

I'm not bashing the Apple ecosystem at all, I actually really enjoy using Apple devices and applaud how easy they've made it to integrate their various devices into our lives. What bothers me is how difficult it is to escape them once you've embraced them.

# The Consistency of Apples

Apple are very consistent with their device releases, they normally get released around the same time each year, every year. 

We can also predict which devices will be releasing and when for the next few years. This allows people to plan their upgrades very conveniently and with Apple's trade in program, it's easier than ever to upgrade when a new model of whatever device you have is released.

Being 'trapped' in this ecosystem and constant upgrade cycle made me feel limited in what hardware I was able to use and I wanted to find a way out.

# The Slow Burn

## Apple Watch

I didn't get rid of all my Apple devices at once, it was a slow and gradual purge starting with my Apple Watch.

As someone who likes to track everything in my life, tracking my activity was seamless with an Apple Watch. But the constant need to charge the device every night was not ideal and don't get me started on the notification anxiety. 

One day, I decided I'm going to be that hipster and got into G-Shocks. My first G-Shock was a **5610 Multi-Band Solar** and I still wear it daily.

At first it was quite strange not having my wrist constantly buzz throughout the day, but eventually the anxiety started to fade and I finally felt a sense of freedom.

I also don't have to charge my 5610 as it's solar powered, +1 for saving the planet!

## Apple MacBook Pro

The next to go was my MacBook Pro which was easy enough as I was switching to open-source hardware and software around a similar time. I purchased a **Starbook MK V1** from Starlabs and it's been my daily driver using Pop_OS! for over a year.

No complaints so far, the customer service has been amazing and it's the perfect size at 14". 

Going from MacOS to Linux is deserving of a whole other blog post which will come in due course but it definitely is do-able with a little bit of sacrifice, determination and learning.

## AirPods

Around a similar time I got rid of my Spotify premium, I purchased a Walkmann NW-A55 which welcomed the 3.5mm headphone jack back into my life. I now use a pair of Sony **MDR-XB50AP** and they've been nothing but great for my needs.

## Apple iPad

I actually really like my iPad mini, like, ***really*** like it. I can fit it in my pocket, it's small enough to throw in my sling and the Apple Pencil 2nd Gen is second to none. 

For that reason, I still actually use the iPad but only in 2 scenarios:

- Facetiming friends and family
- Procreate for further idea sketches and *some* rendering

I'm still yet to find a device with a similar form factor which I can use instead of the iPad mini 6, but until that day comes, it will stay with me wherever I go.

## Apple iPhone

The one who started it all.

The problem with iPhone is the fact that everyone has one. By switching to the Pixel 5 with CalyxOS, not only was I alienating myself from my friends and family, I was making it more difficult on myself if I forgot my wallet as I now no longer had Apple Pay to rely on.

In the UK, I found we don't actually use iMessage as much as other countries so I wasn't missing much when it came to communication. I could just install WhatsApp (ugh, I still need to talk to *some* people), Signal and Matrix to stay connected with my friends and family.

I turned my iPhone off for the last time almost half a year ago and haven't looked back.

# The iCloud Struggle and Solution

The biggest pitfall is on the software side of things. Having iOS along with MacOS, iPadOS and an iCloud drive meant all my files synced perfectly together. I could also use AirDrop to send things to myself from other devices.

It really is noticeable when you get rid of this setup how convenient it actually is.

Still fuelled with determination to break out from the those perfectly placed Apple chains on my ankles, I spent hours on [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) to find other open-source solutions to suit my needs.

I now use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync files between my Pixel 5, Starbook and main PC. Syncthing has been a breath of fresh air to replace my iCloud drive and pretty much provides the same setup on any set of devices you want.

# Not For Everyone

I appreciate not everyone will find it as easy to move away from Apple and may be a little apprehensive to take the first step. I say this as someone who is interested in finding new solutions that suit my needs more specifically (pfft... typical Engineer) but for the majority of people, Apple's devices and Apple's ecosystem is more than enough for them.

Change also requires effort and not everyone may be that interested in inconveniencing themselves to switch to perhaps less optimised solutions. Again, my main motivation for the drastic change was to move to open-source hardware and software and this was just one step of the journey.

If you're looking to take the plunge and jump over Apple's perimeter walls to dive into other technology, it's definitely possible and I hope I've given you some realistic insight into how to plan your great escape.
