excerpt: Work in Progress update for the PiDA.

If you've ever played the game S.T.A.L.K.E.R you will undoubtedly be familiar with the PDA. If not, the PDA is your personal digital assistant that tracks your quests, helps you navigate the exclusion zone, allows you to communicate with people and also has a really cool sound when you whip it out.

I really enjoy zombie films and games so naturally I'm quite interested in survival-ism and general apocalyptic preparation. People think I'm crazy, I think I'm just optimistic (*my bugout back contains 4 cans of chickpeas and a kilo of peanut butter, who wouldn't want to be in an apocalypse?!*).

I've always wondered what it would be like if we were all in a DayZ server or the Cloverfield aliens destroyed most of our cities; I'm assuming phone towers would be one of the many things to be blown to smithereens. 

**How would we navigate where to go?**

**How can we contact other people to let them know our whereabouts?**

***"Wow, you just described a dumb phone!"***

Pretty much. If we had to rely on ourselves with no external help, would we be able to do it without our phones?

I guess the idea for the 'PiDA' is just a really feature specific digital device that doesn't rely on any other services apart from radio. In an apocalypse, there's always one radio tower left standing...

Oh, it's also making use of a Raspberry Pi hence the name. The release of the Raspberry Pi 5 brings 3x as much speed over the previous generation so it should be able to run all our applications with ease.

# Features

Let's strip away all the unnecessary apps and front-facing cameras, no one wants to see my apocalypse beard. What do we really need?

## Hardware

- **Touchscreen** to be able to navigate the OS.
- **GPS** for navigation and knowing current location.
- **Microphone** to be able to speak over the radio.
- **Camera** to be able to take pictures for reporting purposes.
- **Solar Powered** to avoid the need for electricity.
- **Battery Backup** to be prepared.
- **Data Storage** to keep the most important digital data you need.

## Software

- **Maps** to visualise GPS coordinates.
- **Communication** software to pick up radio signals.
- **File explorer** to organise and view data.

# Where to start?

Phones these days are roughly 6"-7" in diagonal size but as we only need the necessary features of a smartphone, we have some flexibility in sizing of the PiDA.

I want it to be pocket-able and light enough to carry around everyday, but also big enough to comfortably view a map and read through files.

Once I get 8-12 initial ideas, I'll review them in the next WIP update to see which ideas are most feasible and work the best in an apocalyptic setting.
