I suppose EDC and tools are quite a big part of my life and have been since I was a child where I was apparently very obsessive over all kinds of stationery. I constantly changed my pencil case, trying to find the best fit for all my pens and pencils - and I guess that habit just kept forming over time to where we are now!

Most of what is in this list is my ***actual*** everyday carry. I take these things with me to work, when I'm travelling, when I'm at university and probably only leave them at home if I'm not allowed to bring a bag somewhere.

If you're looking for something that's not listed on this page, feel free to [contact me](/contact) and ask.

## COLOURS

I normally cycle through [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) and [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) depending on the time of year. To prevent mass distraction, I use the same black and white hex codes (my own) and just change the colours between.
