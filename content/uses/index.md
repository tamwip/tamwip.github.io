I suppose EDC and tools are quite a big part of my life and have been since I was a child where I was apparently very obsessive over all kinds of stationery. I constantly changed my pencil case, trying to find the best fit for all my pens and pencils - and I guess that habit just kept forming over time to where we are now!

Most of what is in this list is my ***actual*** everyday carry. I take these things with me to work, when I'm travelling, when I'm at university and probably only leave them at home if I'm not allowed to bring a bag somewhere.

## HARDWARE + CARRY



## OPERATING SYSTEMS

I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) (btw) on my laptop and [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) on my PC. Pop_OS! was my first Linux distribution and I still recommend it to those who are seeking ease of use when it comes to gaming on Linux.

I use [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) on my Pixel.

## COLOURS

I normally cycle through [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) and [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) depending on the time of year. To prevent mass distraction, I use the same black and white hex codes (my own) and just change the colours between.
