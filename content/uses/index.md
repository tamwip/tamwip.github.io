EDC and tools are a big part of my life and I've developed my own ritualistic approach to what I keep on me at all times. The things I use all have a seperate purpose. I could easily use my phone for most of the things on this list but I don't. The philosophy of compartmentalising allows me to focus on the task at hand and utilise the selected technology I need with intention.

Most of what is in this list is my ***actual*** everyday carry. I take these things with me everywhere and probably only leave them at home if I'm not allowed to bring a bag somewhere.

If you're looking for something that's not listed on this page, feel free to [contact me](/contact) and ask.
