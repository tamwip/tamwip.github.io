Everything on this website is uncopyrighted. Being in a simulation, most our ideas aren't unique or original. So I figured why claim anything I've put out?

The code for this website was taken directly from [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/), who also uncopyrighted his website, with a few tweaks here and there.

Attribution is appreciated, but not required.

More specifically, all the content is under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). You can find the full "license" on the [GitHub repo for this project](https://github.com/tamwip/tamwip.github.io/blob/main/LICENCE.md).
