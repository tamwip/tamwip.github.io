title: BIOGRAPHY
---
I'm an engineer by trade, designer by night and artist by drive. I'm currently working on [Notalegt](https://notalegt.xyz/) which aims to be a lifelong artistic project, born from the synthesis between engineering, design and art.\n\n

...all my ideas, my interests and my inventions, throughout my time on planet Earth.
