I suppose EDC and tools are quite a big part of my life and have been since I was a child where I was apparently very obsessive over all kinds of stationery. I constantly changed my pencil case, trying to find the best fit for all my pens and pencils - and I guess that habit just kept forming over time to where we are now!

Most of what is in this list is my *actual* everyday carry. I take these things with me to work, when I'm travelling, when I'm at university and probably only leave them at home if I'm not allowed to bring a bag somewhere.
